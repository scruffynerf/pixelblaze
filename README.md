Pixelblaze patterns, mappers, and other tools for nifty LED lightshows.

This will include improved patterns, mappers for LED layouts, and anything else I find/create to work with Pixelblaze.

Much of the discussion/development happens on the pixelblaze forum, and then eventually, I add items to this repo.
Patches accepted, of course.  Any support for any code here should happen on https://forum.electromage.com/

More on Pixelblaze itself at https://electromage.com and https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze
I expect folks to use the latest v3 firmware (there are definitely improvements often)
